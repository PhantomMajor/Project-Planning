# PROJECT PLANNING #

Project planning saves time, money and prevents a lot of problems.


## Step 1: Goals ##

A project is successful when the __needs__ of the stakeholders (anyone impacted by the project) are met.

Examples of Stakeholders:
- Sopnsor
- Customer
- User of project output
- Project Manager
- Project Team

1. Identify the stakeholders -> Find out their needs -> Prioritize the needs

2. Create a set of easily measurable goals


## Step 2: Project Deliverables ##

Create a list of things that the project needs to deliver.
Add an estimate date of delivery of the item.


## Step 3: Scheduling ##

Create a list of tasks that need to be carried out for each deliverable. For each task determine:

- The amount of effort required to complete it.
- The resource who will carry out the task.

If the imposed delivery date is not realistic, contact the sponsor immidately. Three available options are:

- Renegotiate the deadline (project delay)
- Employ additional resources (increased cost)
- Reduce the scope of the project (less delivered)

Project schedule is used to justify one of these three.


## Step 4: Supporting Plans ##

These can be directly included in the plan.

#### Human Resource Plan ####
Identify the individuals with a leading role in the project. Describe their roles and responsibilities.

#### Communication Plan ####
A document describing who is to be kept informed about about the project and how they will keep them informed. It involves a daily and a weekly sitrep.

#### Risk Management Plan ####
One of the most important part of project planning.

Here are a few examples of project risks:
- Time and cost estimate too optimistic.
- Customer review and feedback cycle too slow.
- Unexpected budget cuts.
- Unclear roles and responsibilities.
- Not clearly understanding the stakeholder's needs.
- Stakeholders changing the needs after the project has started.
- Stakeholders adding new needs.
- Poor comms. resulting in:
    + Misunderstanding
    + Quality problems
    + Rework
- Lack of resource commitment.

Risks can be tracked using a simple __Risk Log__. Add each risk you have identified in your riks log. Review your risk log on a regular basis.
